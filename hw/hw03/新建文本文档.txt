Stem cell research holds huge potential for medicine and human health. As for the fate of stem cells, all regulatory networks converge on the regulation of gene expression besides external factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate mRNA stability and consequently protein production, are believed to have a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Therefore, more researches about its role in differentiation and maintenance of stem cells are done to provide new insights into internal factors of the fate of the stem cells.



Japan has the world's longest life expectancy, little immigration, and a dwindling population of young workers due to decades of low birthrates. More than half of Japanese taxi drivers are over the age of 60, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, while less than 10 percent are under 40. The aging of Japan's work force is prompting a rethinking of traditional career paths and government safety nets. Shigekazu Miyazaki, a pilot with nearly four decades' experience at Japan's All Nippon Airways, left the carrier last yaer at its mandatory retirement age of 65. Since April he has been piloting 39-sear propeller plans for Oriental Air Bridge. Under current Japanese regulations, he will have to stop flying commercially at 68, but the government has started examing whether to extend the maximum age to 70.
